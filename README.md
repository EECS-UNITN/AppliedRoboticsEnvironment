# Project of Apply robotics laboratory 
In this course the student will be introduced to a complete methodology for designing modern robot applications. The target applications will be those for which system intelligence plays a prominent role, first and foremost planning, task optimisation and perception. The student activities will revolve around a motivational application proposed in the form of a simple robotic competition, in which the robot has to complete a number of tasks in minimum time avoiding obstacles and dangerous spots. Contrary to a standard robotic competition, the student will have to discuss the theoretical underpinning of the method she/he chose to adopt for the competition. 

## Project objectives
- development and implementation of sensing algorithms to recognise objects and obstacles in the competition field
- development and implementation of motion planning algorithms to move the robot from an initial to a final position in minimum time avoiding obstacles
- development and implementation of intelligent planning algorithms to decide the optimal game strategy
- testing of the solution in simulation and on the field
